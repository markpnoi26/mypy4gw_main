"""Real (non-placeholder) launcher window entry point (RELAY 010) -- replaces
Phase A's 3-window inline-HTML demo (dev_notes/RELAY.md 008/009) with the
approved design (Guild Wars Launcher Redesign Round 4, see
dev_notes/mockups/KEEP_DISCARD_ALTER_ADD.md) hand-rebuilt as real files under
pywebview_shell/web/, plus one real data path (ShellBridge.list_profiles()).

One window, not three -- the approved design's Settings drawer slides in
*inside* the main window rather than opening as a separate OS window (a
genuine upgrade over the current shipped app's separate App Settings window,
per KEEP_DISCARD_ALTER_ADD.md), so Phase A's main/settings/app_settings
3-window shape no longer applies. All of Phase A's proven window mechanics
(DPI-awareness, native-HWND resize via edge/corner hit-zones, frameless
custom title bar, easy_drag dragging) carry over unchanged into this single
window's markup.

Frameless (dev_notes/RELAY.md 008): the app draws its own title row. Native
Aero Snap can't work here (RELAY 009 -- Windows only snaps during its own
modal caption-drag loop, which a frameless window can't enter without
WS_CAPTION, which repaints the native title bar; and easy_drag moves via
SetWindowPos, never entering that loop). Snap is instead reproduced
hand-rolled (snap.py + preview.py, dev_notes/AERO_SNAP_INVESTIGATION.md): the
bridge observes the title-bar drag (on_drag_start/on_drag_end from web/app.js)
and on release over a screen edge/corner applies the snapped rect itself --
half/quarter/maximize, restore-on-drag-away, and a live preview overlay drawn
in the theme's --accent. Not reproduced (accepted trade-off): the Win11 Snap
Layouts hover flyout and keyboard Win+arrow snap.

# below ~340px wide, #action-row's buttons wrap to a 2nd line, which eats
# ~38px of EXTRA vertical space that a width-only or height-only test would

# wants) at each combination:
#   - Width alone (600 tall): clean at 320px; 290px wraps the header title
#     onto 2 lines AND clips card content behind a horizontal scrollbar.
#   - Height alone (600 wide, no wrap): clean at 250px; 240px clips/overlaps
#     the console bar's own text.
#   - BOTH at their independently-found floor (320x250) simultaneously:
#     broken -- the 2-line-wrapped action row (only present at narrow width)
#     ate enough extra height to push the card grid AND console bar
#     completely out of the visible window, invisible not just cramped.
#   - Re-tested height at the ACTUAL chosen width (320) to find the real
#     combined floor: clean at 300px, with a safety margin above the
#     270-290px zone where the console bar starts running right up against
