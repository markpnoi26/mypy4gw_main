"""Python<->JS bridge scaffold. Phase A proves the mechanism works cleanly
in this app's real structure -- no real business logic wired to it yet.

Bidirectional shape:
- JS -> Python: any public method on a ShellBridge instance, called from JS
  as `window.pywebview.api.<method_name>(...)` -- pywebview's normal js_api
  contract, unchanged.
- Python -> JS: `push_event`, calling back into the page via
  `window.evaluate_js(...)` to invoke a JS-side handler. This is the shape
  later phases wire up for real push updates (live console lines, per-card
  launch status) without the page needing to poll Python for state.

    model. The window back-reference is bound after webview.create_window()
    returns -- the bridge needs it to push events back into the page, but
    js_api has to be handed to create_window before that object exists.

    ROOT CAUSE, found during Phase A smoke testing: this back-reference must
    stay on a name starting with `_`. pywebview rebuilds its callable-method
    map on every JS->Python call by walking `dir(bridge)` (see
    `webview.util.get_functions`), skipping only underscore-prefixed names,
    and recursing into any *public*, non-callable attribute it finds. An
    earlier version exposed this as a public `window` property -- `dir()`
    doesn't skip properties, so `get_functions` dereferenced it, got the live
    `webview.Window`, and recursed into its `.native` (a real pythonnet/COM
    WinForms object), which is fully self-referential when introspected this
    way (`.native.AccessibilityObject.Bounds.Empty.Empty.Empty...`),
    producing a runaway recursion that hung the process -- reproduced on a
    genuine mouse click, not just the automation used to test this. A
    weakref alone didn't fix it (this isn't a GC/cycle issue -- `getattr()`
    still resolves to the live object either way); keeping the name private
    is what makes `get_functions` skip it entirely. The original RELAY 006
    spike's `Api` class never hit this because it never exposed anything
    window-shaped as a public attribute.

    Also owns the custom title bar's window-control calls (minimize/
    maximize/close) -- frameless windows have no native chrome to provide
    these, so the HTML title bar's buttons call back into Python for them,
    same round trip shape as everything else JS->Python.
