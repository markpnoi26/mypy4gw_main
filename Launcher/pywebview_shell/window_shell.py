Windows are frameless (custom HTML/CSS title bar, no native OS caption), a
deliberate call made after hands-on testing of both bordered and frameless
(dev_notes/RELAY.md 008): the app draws its own title row, so there's no
native caption left to theme. The bordered/DWM path was fully proven working
in spikes/pywebview/ (RELAY 006) and is preserved there and in git history,
not carried into the real shell since it isn't needed.
