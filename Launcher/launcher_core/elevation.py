"""Global "run as administrator" toggle (RELAY 035) -- elevates the
LAUNCHER's own process, not each individual GW1 launch. gw1_launch.py's
CreateProcessW(CREATE_SUSPENDED, ...) call passes no explicit token/security
attributes, so a child process it spawns inherits whatever token the
launcher process itself is running under -- if the launcher is elevated,
every profile launched from it is elevated too, with zero changes needed in
gw1_launch.py. Elevating the individual Gw.exe launch instead (via
ShellExecuteEx's own "runas" verb) would run it through a separate elevated
broker process that doesn't expose CreateProcessW's low-level creation-flags
control the suspended-injection technique depends on -- a real,
likely-incompatible fight against the existing pipeline, not a small change.
