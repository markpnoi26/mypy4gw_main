"""Check whether a newer Py4GW_Reforged_Launcher release exists on GitHub, by
comparing launcher_core.version.__version__ against the latest release's
tag_name. A single stdlib urllib.request GET + JSON parse against GitHub's
releases API -- no new dependency (requests, etc.) needed for something
this simple.

Comparison is deliberately simple: a numeric (major, minor, patch) tuple,
not real semver-with-prerelease ordering. Every tag this project has ever
cut is "X.Y.Z-alpha" -- the "-alpha" suffix never varies and carries no
ordering information, so it's stripped rather than compared. This is a
low-stakes informational notice, not a release gate, so building real
semver/prerelease-ordering logic isn't worth the complexity here.

Every function here is synchronous and blocking (a real network call) --
same convention as launcher_core.prereqs/mod_repo: callers on the UI thread
run this on a background thread and poll for the result, never call it
directly from the render loop.

RELAY 067: currently unreferenced from the UI (the "Check for updates"
button, its status row, and the auto-check-at-startup call were all
removed from app.js/index.html) -- Apo isn't going to keep cutting
GitHub Releases for this launcher going forward, so a check against
whether a newer *release* exists would be checking something about to
stop happening, not just an unused feature. This module and bridge.py's
own methods around it (fetch_latest_release_tag, is_newer_version_
available, releases_page_url) are left fully intact on purpose -- not
dead code to clean up, just dormant. Safe to wire back into the UI if
the distribution model ever moves back toward discrete GitHub Releases.
