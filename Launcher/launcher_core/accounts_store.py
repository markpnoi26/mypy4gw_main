"""RELAY 066: owns `Settings/Py4GW_Reforged_Launcher/accounts.json` -- the
single, permanent data store for this app's profiles and teams, replacing
profile_store.py's `%APPDATA%\\...\\profiles.json`/`teams.json` entirely.

Real context (agreed live with Apo on Discord, see dev_notes/RELAY.md 066):
this launcher is becoming the only launcher, so there's no import/migration
step -- accounts.json itself is the permanent store, forever, with this
app's own fields added into it rather than copied elsewhere. Separately,
accounts.json was committed once in this repo's actual initial commit and
is still reachable from `remotes/upstream/main` with 8 real accounts'
plaintext credentials -- the reason this file now lives under `Settings/`
(covered by the existing `Settings/*/` gitignore rule, verified directly
via `git check-ignore`, zero new lines needed) rather than the mod repo
root, and the reason plaintext passwords are converted to a DPAPI blob
the moment this app ever sees them.

On-disk shape is UNCHANGED from the old standalone launcher's own format
(team name -> list of account dicts) -- "don't reinterpret" was Apo's own
explicit requirement, since other tools (Layout Manager.py) hard-read this
exact shape. A profile belonging to N teams gets N full copies of its
account dict, one per team-name key, kept identical since this app is now
the only writer (unlike the old launcher's uncoordinated hand-edits, which
is exactly what let copies drift and produced RELAY 060/061's "teams came
in empty" bug). Unknown/legacy fields this app doesn't model (gw_client_
name, enable_client_rename, run_as_admin, the old runtime-stat fields,
etc.) are preserved verbatim across a save, not stripped -- see
_EXTRA_FIELDS_CACHE below. The one deliberate exception is the plaintext
`password` key, which never survives a save once this app has touched the
account (see _account_from_dict).

A profile with zero team memberships (a very normal state -- e.g. right
after "+Add Profile" before assigning a team) has nowhere to live in a
format where team NAME is literally the only bucket a JSON object can sit
under. Real gap the entry text didn't address; resolved by writing such
profiles under one reserved key (_UNASSIGNED_TEAM_KEY) that's excluded
from the real team list load_teams() returns, so it never appears as a
selectable team in the UI -- just a storage bucket, matching the same
"ALL isn't a real team" pattern this app already uses elsewhere.
