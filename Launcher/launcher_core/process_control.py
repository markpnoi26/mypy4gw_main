"""Terminate a running client process by PID.

Phase E (individual-launch wiring) needs a "Stop" that kills an already-running,
already-injected GW client -- a different, simpler thing than cancelling an
in-progress launch (which never touches an already-launched client; see TODO.md).
No such utility existed before this: gw1_launch.py's only TerminateProcess is its
own failed-launch abort, which acts on the process HANDLE it created, not an
arbitrary PID. This is the by-PID version.

On Windows psutil's terminate() and kill() are both TerminateProcess (there's no
graceful signal), so a single terminate()+wait is enough; kill() is a belt-and-
suspenders retry if the process somehow outlives the wait.
