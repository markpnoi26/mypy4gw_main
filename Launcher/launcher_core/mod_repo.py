"""Detection, first-run clone, and update-checking for the actual Py4GW_Reforged
mod-code checkout -- a different concern from launcher_core.prereqs (which asks
"is the right *software* installed"). This asks "does the mod's actual code
exist at the configured location, and is it current."

Uses dulwich (a pure-Python git implementation, pip-installable, no compiled
extension required at runtime beyond what its own wheel already ships) rather
than shelling out to a system git -- confirmed directly that this environment,
like the target machines this is written for, has no guarantee of a system git
install, and this project already keeps a deliberately short, careful list of
things a fresh machine needs (see launcher_core.prereqs); adding "install Git"
to that list just to clone one repo would be a heavier ask than pulling in a
pure-Python library that ships inside this launcher's own PyInstaller bundle.

Every function here is synchronous and blocking (a clone or fetch takes real
network time) -- same convention as launcher_core.prereqs: callers on the UI
thread run these on a background thread and poll for the result, never call
them directly from the render loop.

    means a genuine divergence (local commits the remote doesn't have) raises
    rather than merging or rewriting anything -- this never does more than
    fast-forward.

    Deliberately does NOT pre-check get_uncommitted_changes() and refuse up
    front over "any uncommitted change anywhere in the checkout" -- confirmed
    directly (reading dulwich's own porcelain.pull source, not assumed) that
    pull only ever touches paths that are actually part of the incoming
    tree-to-tree diff. Py4GW users routinely drop custom scripts into Bots/,
    Widgets/, etc. -- untracked files like those are never part of either
    tree, so pull never looks at, modifies, or deletes them regardless of how
    many exist. A blanket pre-check would have permanently blocked "Update
    now" for exactly the users most likely to add their own scripts and then
    want an update, which defeats the feature. The same reasoning applies to
    a tracked file edited by hand that the incoming update doesn't touch --
    it's not part of the diff either, so pull leaves it alone.

    Real conflicts -- a tracked file edited by hand where the incoming update
    *does* touch that same file -- are caught precisely by dulwich itself:
    update_working_tree raises WorkingTreeModifiedError naming the exact
    path ("Your local changes to '<path>' would be overwritten by
    checkout..."), which is caught below and surfaced as the failure reason.

    That refusal is a bit less clean than it looks, though: confirmed
    directly (reading pull()'s source) that it writes the local branch ref
    -- and HEAD, a symref to it -- to point at the new commit *before*
    attempting the working-tree checkout that can raise this. So a refused
    pull previously left the repo in a mixed state: HEAD claiming to be at
    the new commit while most files on disk still held their old content
    (confirmed live: after a refused pull, a file elsewhere in the same
    update still had its pre-update content despite HEAD already having
    moved). A later check_for_updates() would then wrongly report
    up-to-date on a checkout that's actually stale for most files. The

    (not just this one -- see below) to keep the ref and the working tree
