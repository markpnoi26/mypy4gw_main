"""App-native roster export/import: profiles + teams as one JSON bundle.

Deliberately writes passwords in PLAINTEXT, under a differently-named field
(``password_plaintext``) than the stored DPAPI blob (``password_protected``).
Two reasons for plaintext rather than copying the encrypted blob: a DPAPI blob is
scoped to one Windows user account on one machine, so it's undecryptable after the
move this feature exists to enable; and the distinct field name keeps an export
bundle visually unmistakable from profiles.json at a glance. The plaintext is a
real secret at rest -- the UI warns before writing one (see launcher.py's export
confirm popup), and this module never writes an export except when asked to.

This is separate from accounts.json (accounts_store) on purpose: that's the
app's own storage, this is an interchange format that travels between
machines/users.
