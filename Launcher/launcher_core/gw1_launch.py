"""GW1 launch pipeline: CreateProcessW (suspended) -> multiclient patch -> resume ->
handle the updater/relaunch handoff -> wait for window -> inject a DLL.

Adapted from the proven primitives already in this repo's root ``Patcher.py`` and
``Py4GW_Launcher.py`` (``Patcher.patch``/``launch_and_patch``, ``GWLauncher.inject_dll``/
``wait_for_gw_window``) -- same ctypes calls, same signature bytes, same offsets. Not a
rewrite: this only reshapes that logic around a ``GameProfile`` input and a single
``LaunchResult`` return value instead of the launcher's global ``log_history`` list and
UI/account model.

Scope for this slice (deliberately narrow): Py4GW injection only -- no gMod injection
yet (near-identical follow-up once this is proven). GW1 auto-login (``-email``/
``-password``/``-character``) is wired up, ported from GWxLauncher's
``Gw1InjectionService`` auto-login arg builder -- see ``_build_auto_login_args``. This
is a headless, scriptable entry point: call ``launch_py4gw_profile(profile)`` and read
the ``LaunchResult``.

``profile.py4gw_enabled`` is no longer a hard requirement to launch at all -- a
profile with it off still launches normally (process creation, the multiclient patch,
resume, window-wait all still happen), it just skips the DLL-injection step. Only the
py4gw_dll_path validation and the actual injection call are conditional on it.

Updater/relaunch handoff (rare, only during a large content update)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This GW1 client build *can* launch a short-lived update/patcher process first (named
``Gw.tmp``, confirmed via live process-tree monitoring), which exits once the update
is applied, after which the real, final ``Gw.exe`` starts under a new PID -- possibly
from a different install folder than the one launched. Empirically, this only happens
when there's an actual large update to apply: with no update pending, the originally
launched process stays alive and never spawns anything -- confirmed by a clean retest
with no hop, no ``Gw.tmp``, injection straight into the original PID. So this handoff
is real but rare, not the normal case, and shouldn't be assumed to happen on every
launch.

A third variant, also confirmed live: a large individual data-file re-download (e.g.
``Gw.dat``, ~7k files) can happen entirely in-place inside the original process, with
no hop and no hang signal at all -- injection succeeded before the download even
started, and the client (with Py4GW already attached) survived the download running
underneath it. So "large content update" doesn't necessarily imply the exit/relaunch
path; it can also just be silent background I/O in an otherwise-normal, responsive
process.

I looked for the equivalent handling in GWxLauncher's C# GW1 pipeline
(``Gw1LaunchOrchestrator``, ``Gw1InjectionService``, ``Gw1InstanceTracker``,
``Gw1ClientStateProbe``) and did not find an explicit "wait for the first process to
exit, then rescan for the real one" mechanism there for the direct-launch path -- so
this isn't a straight port of existing C# logic the way the injection primitives are.
The one adjacent pattern that *does* exist is ``Gw1InjectionService
.TryApplyMulticlientPatchToRunningProcess`` / ``TryInjectGModBestEffort``, used on the
Steam-launch path to patch/inject into a process the launcher didn't create (and
therefore couldn't suspend) -- ``_apply_multiclient_patch`` here is reused the same
way against the rescanned second-stage process, best-effort, since it can't be
suspended either.

Behavior: after resuming the first (suspended, patched) process, `_wait_for_window_or_exit`
polls once for whichever happens first -- a window on that same still-alive process
(the normal case), or the process exiting (the rare update-hop case). This has to be
a single combined poll and not two sequential waits: waiting out a fixed exit-timeout
before ever checking for a window would burn that entire timeout on every normal
launch, even though the window typically appears within a few seconds. The wait
itself is stall-based, not elapsed-time-based -- see `_wait_for_window_or_exit`'s
docstring for why (short version: a window reporting hung via ``IsHungAppWindow`` is
treated as "still legitimately busy," not a timeout, so a genuinely slow update
doesn't get killed just for taking a while). Only on the "exited" branch do we scan
for a replacement process and re-apply the multiclient patch to it (best-effort,
since it's already running and can't be suspended).

Reserved extension point
-------------------------
``launch_py4gw_profile`` takes an optional ``pre_injection_config`` (see
``PreInjectionConfig`` below). This is an explicit, documented no-op today, not real
logic -- nothing sets it, and `launch_py4gw_profile` does nothing with it even if
something did. It exists because Apo mentioned a name-obfuscation config that will
need to reach the child process before it resumes, and the exact mechanism (env var
vs. file, and the data shape) is still his call to make. See `PreInjectionConfig`'s
docstring for the reasoning behind keeping this inert rather than building real
environment-block-construction logic against a guessed format.

    gMod resolves modlist.txt relative to wherever its *injected* DLL module
    actually lives, not wherever the canonical DLL sits on disk -- confirmed
    from gMod's own source and GWxLauncher's tested PreparePerProfileGModFolder.
    So each profile gets its own folder (RELAY 066: `<mod repo root>\\Settings\\
    Py4GW_Reforged_Launcher\\accounts\\<profile.id>\\` -- moved off %AppData%
    together with accounts.json/launcher_settings.json, same "everything
    stays inside the repo" requirement) containing:

    - A per-launch DLL named `gMod_<pid>_<ns>.dll` -- hardlinked to
      profile.gmod_dll_path when possible (os.link), otherwise copied
      (shutil.copy2 fallback for cross-volume cases). The filename is unique
      per launch (not the fixed name "gMod.dll") to sidestep a Windows-only
      lock interaction: every profile's gmod_dll_path auto-defaults to the
      *same* source file (`<mod_root>/Addons/gMod.dll` -- see
      mod_root.find_dll_under_mod_root), so once account #1 launches and
      GW.exe #1 has that file loaded as an executable, the underlying NTFS
      inode is opened without FILE_SHARE_WRITE. Re-hardlinking the source
      then fails with ACCESS_DENIED (CreateHardLinkW needs
      FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES on the source to bump its link count), and even
      the shutil.copy2 fallback can trip: unlink() of the previous
      per-profile "gMod.dll" marks it delete-pending while the loaded inode
      is still referenced, and open(dst, 'wb') at that same path returns
      ACCESS_DENIED until every handle closes. A fresh unique filename each
      launch avoids both problems -- the injector uses LoadLibraryA on the
      full path so the filename doesn't matter, and gMod only cares about
      its DLL's *folder* for modlist.txt lookup.
    - modlist.txt: one absolute path per line, from profile.gmod_plugin_paths.
      Entries that don't currently exist on disk are pruned from this file but
      never from profile.gmod_plugin_paths itself -- a temporarily missing
      path (an unplugged USB drive, say) shouldn't permanently drop a
      configured mod, just skip it for this one launch.

    Best-effort deletes any stale `gMod_*.dll` siblings from prior launches,
    plus any pre-fix legacy `gMod.dll` at the folder root -- expected to
    succeed for exited processes' files, and to silently fail (leaving the
    file for a later pass) while a previous launch is still running with its
    DLL loaded.

    Raises on any failure that actually blocks producing a usable DLL for
    this launch (folder creation, or both the hardlink and the copy fallback
    failing) rather than swallowing it -- the caller aborts the launch on
    this, same as any other injection-prep failure in this pipeline.

    `profile.py4gw_enabled`/`profile.gmod_enabled` each gate only their own
    DLL-path validation and injection call: a profile with both off still gets
    a completely normal launch (process creation, the multiclient patch,
    resume, window-wait), just with nothing injected. Auto-login
    (`-email`/`-password`/`-character`) is applied whenever
    `profile.auto_login_enabled` and credentials are configured, regardless of
    either injection toggle -- see `_build_auto_login_args`.

    Py4GW and gMod inject at opposite points in the pipeline, because gMod
    must be loaded and hooked before the game creates its D3D9 device (very
    early), while Py4GW injects after the window appears and settles: gMod
    goes in between `_apply_multiclient_patch` and `kernel32.ResumeThread`,
    while the process is still suspended; Py4GW goes in near the end, after
    `_wait_for_window_or_exit` confirms a window and `post_window_settle_delay`
    passes. See `_prepare_per_profile_gmod_folder` for why gMod's DLL is never
    injected from `profile.gmod_dll_path` directly.

    `multiclient_enabled`, `py4gw_injection_enabled`, and `gmod_injection_enabled`
    are the global App Settings master switches (see AppState.multiclient_enabled/
    py4gw_injection_enabled/gmod_injection_enabled in launcher.py) -- all default
    True so a caller that doesn't pass them gets today's existing behavior.
    `multiclient_enabled` gates both `_apply_multiclient_patch` call sites; off,
    the patch is skipped entirely rather than attempted-and-ignored.
    `py4gw_injection_enabled`/`gmod_injection_enabled` each gate their DLL-path
    validation and injection step the same way `profile.py4gw_enabled`/
    `profile.gmod_enabled` already do -- both must be true for injection to
    actually happen, so a globally-off switch can't be defeated by a single
    profile's own toggle, and a profile with injection off isn't blocked by an
    unrelated missing DLL path when injection is already globally disabled.

    `LaunchResult.pid` is whichever process ends up injected into (or, if
    `py4gw_enabled` is off, whichever process the launch ultimately resolves to) --
    if the updater/relaunch handoff (see module docstring) happens, that's the
    second, replacement process, not the one this function originally created.

    `pre_injection_config` is accepted but intentionally unused -- see
    `PreInjectionConfig`'s docstring for why.

    This function blocks for the full duration of the launch (seconds to, rarely,
    tens of minutes during a large update) -- callers driving a UI from this should
    run it on a background thread and use `on_log` to observe progress live rather
    than blocking the UI thread. `on_log` is called with each raw log line as it's
    produced (same strings that end up in `LaunchResult.log`); it's called from
    whatever thread `launch_py4gw_profile` itself runs on, so it must not touch
