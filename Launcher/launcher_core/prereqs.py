"""Prerequisite checks for the GW1/Py4GW injection pipeline on the *target*
machine: a separate Python installation (whatever ``py -3.13-32`` resolves
to), the Visual C++ Redistributable, and the DirectX End-User Runtime.
Distinct from launcher.py's own ``sys.maxsize`` self-check, which only
verifies *this launcher's own* interpreter is 32-bit -- these check entirely
different, separately-installed software that GW1 injection needs on the
machine, independent of whatever interpreter is running this launcher's own
code.

The Python check is a direct port of GWxLauncher's
Services/PythonPrereqService.cs -- same probe command, same failure
classification. The VC++ Redistributable and DirectX End-User Runtime checks
are new (not present in that reference), included defensively since it
hasn't yet been confirmed safe to omit for Reforged specifically -- the
DirectX one specifically confirmed necessary by Apo directly (Discord,
2026-04-05), linking Microsoft's own download page and stating it's
"necessary for install".

A DirectX *SDK* (DXSDK_DIR) check -- a different thing entirely from the
End-User Runtime above -- was considered separately and deliberately left
out: verified directly against Py4GW_Reforged_Native's actual CMakeLists.txt,
which links d3d9.lib/d3dcompiler.lib (standard Windows SDK components that
ship with the OS/Windows Update) with no D3DX linkage anywhere -- D3DX is
the only reason the legacy DirectX *SDK* would ever be needed, and this
codebase doesn't use it. The End-User *Runtime* is a separate, real
requirement regardless: it's what actually installs the D3DX9/10/11,
XAudio, XInput, and XACT DLLs a running game/DLL loads at runtime, which is
an entirely different concern from whether a *developer* SDK is present.

Every detection function here is a synchronous, cheap call (a subprocess
probe, a registry read, or a filesystem check) meant to be re-run on every
launch -- no caching, no staleness/expiration handling, since a check this
cheap has no real cost to re-running and a cache only buys complexity for a
problem ("this check is slow") that doesn't exist.
