"""Maps raw gw1_launch pipeline log lines to short, user-facing status text
(classify_progress_message) and to a color category for the raw console line
(classify_progress_category, RELAY 030) -- two different consumers of the
same on_log(message) callback, so both live here rather than each front-end
carrying its own copy.

Shared by both front-ends: the imgui launcher (launcher.py's LaunchSession) and
the pywebview shell (pywebview_shell/bridge.py's per-card launch status and
console). Lives here in launcher_core so all consumers stay in sync from one
source. Pure string mapping, no dependencies.

The needles are substrings of the exact _log() messages gw1_launch.py emits
(plus bridge.py's own [Bulk Launch] lines for classify_progress_category);
order matters (first match wins), so more specific lines come before the
generic ones they'd otherwise also match.

# RELAY 030: category for the RAW console line (a different consumer of the
# same on_log(message) callback than classify_progress_message above -- the
# console shows raw pipeline text verbatim, not the friendly per-card
# status). Categories match the mockup's own real colorMap
# (Launcher.dc.html) exactly: '' (neutral/muted), 'ok' (green), 'warn'
# (amber), 'acc' (blue), 'err' (red) -- reused as literal CSS class suffixes
# by app.js, no separate name mapping needed.
#
# Order matters here too, same reason as above, plus one extra wrinkle:
# several genuinely-failed-sounding messages are deliberately softened to
# 'warn' because gw1_launch.py's own text already frames them as non-fatal
# ("best-effort, continuing", "cosmetic, not a launch failure") or as a
# normal step in the update-relaunch flow ("no longer running"/"no longer
# exists" during the updater-exit-then-relaunch path, not a crash) -- these
# softening needles are checked before the broad "failed" catch-all so they
# don't get swept into 'err'.
