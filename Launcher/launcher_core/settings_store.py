"""JSON load/save for simple launcher-wide settings that don't belong to any
single profile or team: the bulk launch pacing delay, and the configured
location of the Py4GW_Reforged mod-repo checkout (launcher_core.mod_repo).

All settings live in one shared JSON file, so every save here reads the
current file, merges in just the one key being changed, and writes the whole
dict back -- overwriting the file with a single-key dict (an earlier version
of this module did exactly that for the one setting that existed then) would
silently discard whichever other setting was already stored, the moment a
second setting was added.

RELAY 066: relocated from `%APPDATA%\\Py4GW_Reforged_Launcher\\` into
`Settings/Py4GW_Reforged_Launcher/` under the mod repo, per Apo's "everything
stays inside the repo" requirement -- same real reasoning as accounts_store's
own relocation (see that module's docstring). Deliberately resolved via
mod_root._mod_root() directly, NOT mod_root.resolve_mod_repo_path() (the
override-aware version accounts_store.py itself uses) -- this file is where
`mod_repo_path`'s own saved override VALUE lives, so its own location can't
depend on reading that same override first without a circular bootstrap
(read settings.json to find the override, whose path depends on
settings.json). accounts.json has no such constraint (it doesn't store the
mod-repo-path override itself), so it can safely follow the override.
