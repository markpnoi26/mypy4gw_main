"""Type stubs for the native ``PyJson`` embedded module.

Per-account structured JSON documents backed by ``JsonFactory`` (see the Reforged
Native project ``docs/json-factory-design.md``). This is the JSON counterpart of
``PySettings``: same lifecycle (per-``(name, scope)`` document, debounced
autosave, atomic writes, account staging, cross-account copy), but the document
is a nested tree instead of a flat INI.

Addressing is a slash path that walks the tree: ``"ui/window/pos/x"``. A numeric
segment indexes an array: ``"waypoints/0/x"``. Reads never raise — a missing node
or an unconvertible value returns the caller's default.

Global-scope documents are shared by every running client (multibox): their
saves take a cross-process lock and merge a per-document write journal onto the
current on-disk tree, so concurrent accounts do not clobber each other.
