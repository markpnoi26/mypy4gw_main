"""Type stub for the embedded PyChatCommands module.

Dynamic, RUNTIME chat-command registry (Reforged Native). Register a Python callable under a
command name; typing ``/<name> args`` in chat invokes it as ``fn(args, raw)`` on the game thread,
and the ``/<name>`` is swallowed so the game never errors on an unknown slash-command. Same principle
as ``PyCallback`` (native stores the callable and calls it) — the trigger is a command name and the
call carries the parsed arguments (C++ tokenises on whitespace; the handler interprets).

Handler signature: ``def handler(args: list[str], raw: str) -> None`` where ``args`` are the
whitespace-split tokens after the command and ``raw`` is the untouched remainder (escape hatch for
quoting / key=value parsing). Names are case-insensitive. Unknown commands pass through to the game
(so ``/age``, ``/stuck``, ``/resign`` … still work). Aliases = register the same handler under more
than one name.
