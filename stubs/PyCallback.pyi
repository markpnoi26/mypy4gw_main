# PyCallback stub — Reforged Native surface.
# Exact counterpart of src/callback/callback_bindings.cpp in Py4GW_Reforged_Native
# (PYBIND11_EMBEDDED_MODULE(PyCallback)). Frame callback scheduler with phased
# execution and priorities. Enum values from include/callback/callback.h.

# Both enums are registered with .export_values(), so their value names are also
# module-level attributes. NOTE the collision: Phase.Update and Context.Update
# share the name "Update"; Context is registered last, so module-level `Update`
# resolves to Context.Update. Prefer the qualified `Phase.X` / `Context.X` forms.

    # (Phase) is labelled "fn" and the 3rd (the callable) is labelled "phase".

    # marked positional-only, since the bound keyword names are misleading.
