"""Launch Bar function catalog — the curated list of callable "functions".

A *function* is a fire-and-forget call into another library/system that a tile can be bound
to (the third tile kind alongside widgets and system actions). Each entry carries its own
display metadata and a default Font Awesome icon; the user can override the icon per tile.

HOW TO ADD A FUNCTION
---------------------
Append a :class:`LaunchFunction` to :data:`FUNCTIONS` below. Keep ``callback`` a zero-arg
callable that lazy-imports whatever game/library surface it needs *inside* the call, so this
module stays import-safe offline (it is imported by the runtime, never by the pure model):

    def _my_action():
        from Core import GLOBAL_CACHE      # import lazily, inside the callback
        GLOBAL_CACHE.Something.do_it()

    FUNCTIONS.append(LaunchFunction(
        id="travel.toa",            # stable unique key (persisted on the tile)
        name="Travel: ToA",         # display name
        icon="ICON_MAP_MARKER_ALT", # default FA constant NAME (see IconsFontAwesome5)
        group="Travel",             # top-level group in the editor's picker (Roles/Scripts/...)
        category="Cities",          # subgroup under that group
        callback=_my_action,
        tooltip="Travel to the Temple of the Ages.",
    ))

``icon`` is the *name* of an ``ICON_*`` constant on ``IconsFontAwesome5`` (resolved to a glyph
at render time), not the glyph itself — human-readable in the settings file and font-stable.
