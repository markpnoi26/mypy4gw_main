"""Launch Bar — package entry point (boot + per-frame render).

Passive on import: importing this module only defines functions; nothing renders or touches the
game until the launchpad host callback calls :func:`main` once per frame.

This is the entry/orchestration module for the from-scratch configurable floating toolbar that
replaced the old ``LaunchSurface`` UI. It owns the persistent :class:`LaunchBarManager` instance
(``_manager``) and ties the package together; the data model, host and manager live in the sibling
modules of this package. See ``docs/LaunchBar_ImGui_Implementation_Plan.md``.

Note: this module is named ``app`` (not ``LaunchBar``) on purpose — the package already exports a
``LaunchBar`` *class* from :mod:`.model`; this is the launch-bar *application*, a different thing.
