This is a thin, typed wrapper over the native ``PySettings`` module (implemented in
``Py4GW_Reforged_Native/src/settings``). All persistence policy — where files live, when they
bind to disk, and when they are written — is owned by the native ``SettingsManager``; this class
only provides an ergonomic, type-safe Python surface over one *document*.

What a "document" is
--------------------
A document is one INI file identified by a ``(name, scope)`` pair. The native side keeps exactly
one document per pair process-wide, and ``Settings`` mirrors that: constructing ``Settings(name,
scope)`` twice returns the *same* object (see ``__new__``). There is **no open/close/save
lifecycle to manage** — you construct it and read/write; the file takes care of itself.

Scopes (where the file lives, and when it binds)
------------------------------------------------
- ``"account"`` (default) → ``settings/<email>/<name>``. **Per-account** preferences. The file is
  *staged* until the account anchor (the logged-in email) resolves, then binds automatically. In
  practice the email is already present by the time any script runs, so reads/writes behave
  normally from the first frame.
- ``"global"``  → ``settings/Global/<name>``. **Shared across every account** on the machine.
  Binds immediately.

There is deliberately **no ``"root"`` scope** — every named document lives strictly under
``settings/``, so nothing can be written outside the jail by choosing a scope. The single file
allowed at the project root, ``Py4GW.ini`` (a cross-process contract with the external launcher), is
reached only through the path-less :meth:`Settings.py4gw_ini` accessor.

Saving is automatic (do not micro-manage it)
--------------------------------------------
Every setter takes effect **in memory immediately** and marks the document dirty. The native
autosave pump (stepped from the runtime loop) then persists it on a debounce:
- **~2 s after the last write** (it waits for a burst of edits to settle), or
- **at most ~10 s** after the first unsaved change, whichever comes first, and
- a **flush on shutdown** catches anything still dirty.

So the correct pattern is simply: call ``set``/``set_*`` whenever a value changes (or even every
frame — ``set`` skips the write when the value is unchanged) and let the pump do the rest. You do
**not** need a "save every N ms" loop, and you should **not** call ``save()`` to "make it stick";
``save()``/``reload()`` are escape hatches (see their docstrings), not part of normal flow.

Reading and writing
-------------------
Two addressing styles, both backed by the same document:
- **Explicit ``(section, key)``** — ``get_*(section, key, default)`` / ``set_*(section, key, value)``.
  Section and key are separate arguments and are never split on a delimiter, so a name may contain
  ``/``, ``\\``, ``:`` or spaces (e.g. section ``"Widget:Guild Wars\\Triggers/Foo.py"``). Prefer
  this style.
- Typed getters **never raise**: a missing key or text that will not convert returns your default.
- Values are stored as strings on disk (mirroring the legacy configparser format); the typed
  getters parse them back. Keys are **lowercased** (configparser parity); **section names are kept
  verbatim**. ``set`` **dedups** — an unchanged value is not rewritten, so idle re-sets are free.

Typical usage
-------------
    # own a per-account document — just construct it. A document is a process-wide
    # singleton (same (name, scope) -> same object), bound/loaded/seeded automatically
    # by the native side, so there is NO separate ensure/find step: construct where you
    # need it and read/write.
    cfg = Settings("Widgets/MyWidget/MyWidget.ini")                 # account scope (default)
    # cfg = Settings("Foo/Bar.ini", "global")                      # machine-wide

    scale = cfg.get_float("Layout", "scale", 1.0)                   # never throws; default on miss
    cfg.set("Layout", "scale", 1.25)                                # in memory now; autosaved later
    for name, value in cfg.items("Layout").items():
        ...

Autosave and flush cadence are owned entirely by the native side; this module never schedules
writes of its own.

class Settings:
    """A typed, SELF-THROTTLED, self-persisting INI document backed by native ``PySettings``.

    Self-throttled means: you never schedule writes or reads. Setters mutate memory and the native
    autosave pump flushes to disk on a debounce; the document binds/loads itself. ``save()`` (force
    a write now) and ``reload()`` (force a re-read now) are escape hatches — use them only when the
    app genuinely requires it, not in normal flow.

    One instance corresponds to one on-disk file identified by ``(name, scope)``. Instances are
    cached per ``(name, scope)`` (see :meth:`__new__`), so anyone who asks for the same document
    shares the same object and the same in-memory state — there is no risk of two divergent copies.

    You acquire one simply by constructing it: ``Settings("path/filename")`` (account scope) or
    ``Settings("path/filename", "global")`` (machine-wide). Because instances are cached per
    ``(name, scope)``, any code that constructs the same name/scope shares the one live document —
    there is nothing to "ensure" first and no name to pass around and look up.

    Persistence is automatic and debounced (see the module docstring); treat this object as a live,
    always-saved view of the file rather than something you must explicitly load or flush.
