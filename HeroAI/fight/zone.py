    # Measured from the contact point, which is at the FRONT. The known cost is
    # that an enemy which walked around onto the backline reads as a new threat
    # elsewhere and drives a full re-aim, interrupting casts.
    #
    # The standing candidate fix — measure from the party centroid instead — is
    # still REJECTED, though its old reason went with the standoff. A 400u
    # standoff used to plant the pin behind a rushing mob and give ground for
    # free; at zero a re-aim would plant the front rank on top of it, so that
    # fallback is now explicit instead — the overrun guard in anchor_and_facing
    # refuses the rebase and adjust_ground does the withdrawing. What stands on
    # its own is that the party centroid sits a rank and a half behind the

    # centre moves it 150u on death, against 43u at N=8. Movement scales the same
    # way, so the tail of every fight is its twitchiest phase.

    # Refusing to re-aim below a size threshold traded that twitch for a worse

    # pack died, and the party fights the rest of it out of formation. Instead
    # the timing gates stretch as the blob shrinks — the formation keeps
    # re-forming all the way to the last kill, just progressively more slowly.

    # The two gates are tiered separately because they charge for jitter in
    # different currencies. The floor is nearly free: it costs nothing on the
    # first move after a quiet spell and only caps how often a twitchy tail can
    # drag the formation, so it carries most of the slowdown. The commit window

    # early retreat compounds. That asymmetry is what pays for the cadence:

    # purpose (reaim_commit_ms, min_facing_recompute_ms, and slowdown tiers that
    # stretch the floor to 24s for a lone enemy). Through those hold windows the
    # blob slides off-axis and the projection under-reads it. A ring does not

    # do unrelated jobs and only one of them is tunable. Expressed as centre+fwd
    # they cannot move independently, and turning the reach down to close on a
    # camped mob dragged the floor up with it: the floor sat at 436 - tip, so any
    # tip under 436 put it in FRONT of the party's own front rank. A pack that
    # had slipped just behind the front line then read as OUTSIDE the ring and
    # the party advanced into it. Measured at the 300 tip below, against a mob
    # 900u out: it never settles at all, oscillating between 147u and 397u PAST
    # the pack as it walks through, trips the midline ring, gives ground, and
    # does it again.

    # camped mob, and a tip beyond that gap made the party call it close enough
    # and stand there. At 756 a mob 1200u out was left 653u short; at 300 the
    # worst case across that band is 203u.
    #
    # `lat` stays at Earshot — narrowing it is what stops a mob wrapping the
    # flank from registering, and that is the failure worth avoiding.
