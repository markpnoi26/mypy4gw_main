"""Where the party has physically been, kept out to compass range.

The radial scan can only see as far as a straight probe stays on the mesh, which
caps a retreat at about a spellcast and cannot see around a corner at all. A
party backing out of a bad fight usually needs to go further than that, and the
way it came is the only long path that is walkable by construction and costs
nothing to find.

Budgeted by DISTANCE, not by point count. The guarantee that matters is "at
least compass range of history", and a point cap quietly becomes a shorter
guarantee whenever the party happens to move in small steps.
