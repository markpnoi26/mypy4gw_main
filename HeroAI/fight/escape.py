"""Where the party would run if this fight goes wrong.

Plotted while a zone is active and published for the overlay. NOTHING consumes
it — the pin is placed by zone.py exactly as before. This is the map you want to
already have when the formation ends up backed into geometry, not a second
opinion about where to stand.

Two sources. A radial navmesh scan over the full circle handles "where can we go
from right here" — deliberately not restricted to the retreat arc, because
against a wall the only opening is often forward or along it. But a straight
probe reaches about a spellcast and cannot see round a corner, which caps how
far the formation can be pulled back.

So the party's own footprints are the second source, and the long one: walkable
by construction, correct about doglegs, and budgeted out to compass range. That
is what makes a genuinely long retreat possible instead of a 1200u shuffle.
