"""Is the party actually FIGHTING — distinct from having enemies nearby.

InAggro is proximity: an enemy within 1012-1498u of anyone. You can walk past a
camp at 1400u, be "in aggro" the whole way, and never exchange a blow. Dropping
a fight zone on that would stop the party dead in open ground.

Engagement is blows being exchanged: something hostile is attacking or casting
inside a much tighter radius, or party health is going down.
